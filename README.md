# weather-bot
The app uses open-meteo.com api to get weather and tomtom.com geocoding api to get location. The bubble are populated from an array. When the user enters a query, the query is added to the array the app runs through a lot if conditional checks to see if the query includes certain words and if so, executes the corresponding function, and adds the output to the array. Since the app is just checking for certain words, it shouldn't matter if the query is "current temp" or "What is the temperature currently?". The app can give weather info about Current, Today, Tomorrow, Week, Weekend, Hourly, or any day of the week.

The app is now live on GitHub pages. [Click here](https://www.ryanmontville.com/weather-bot/) to load the app.
